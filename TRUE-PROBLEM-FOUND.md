# 🔍 TRUE PROBLEM DISCOVERED

## ❌ PREVIOUS ANALYSIS WAS WRONG:
- fujiglobal.kr/index.html returns **404 NOT FOUND**
- File **DOES NOT EXIST** in server's document root
- Earlier test was false positive

## 🎯 REAL ISSUE:
**Files are uploaded to WRONG LOCATION in Spaceship hosting**

## 🔍 TESTING FILE LOCATIONS:
Checking if files exist in:
1. /public_html/index.html (most likely location)
2. /www/index.html  
3. /htdocs/index.html
4. Other possible document roots

## 📋 CURRENT HYPOTHESIS:
- Files uploaded to root directory but server's document root is different
- Spaceship hosting uses specific document root path
- Need to identify correct upload location

## 🚀 SOLUTION APPROACH:
1. Find where files actually exist
2. Either move files to correct location
3. Or configure server to use current location
4. Or create redirect from document root to file location

**Testing file locations now...**
