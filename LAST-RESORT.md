# ðŸš¨ LAST RESORT - WEBSITE DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## CURRENT STATUS: 
- Files created but returning 404 (not uploaded to correct location)
- Directory listing still showing instead of website
- All file paths return "404 Not Found"

## ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED:
**Files not uploaded to public_html directory or wrong permissions**

## STEP-BY-STEP SOLUTION:

### 1. LOGIN TO SPACESHIP CPANEL
- Go to: https://spaceship.host
- Login with your account credentials
- Find "File Manager" icon

### 2. NAVIGATE TO CORRECT DIRECTORY
- Click "File Manager" 
- **IMPORTANT:** Navigate to `/public_html/` folder
- **NOT** the root directory `/`
- **NOT** `/home/username/`
- Must be: `/public_html/`

### 3. CLEAN DIRECTORY
- Select ALL files in public_html (if any)
- Click "Delete" 
- Confirm deletion
- Directory should be empty

### 4. UPLOAD FILES (ONE AT A TIME)
Upload these files in order:

**File 1: fuji-test-simple.html**
- Click "Upload" 
- Select `fuji-test-simple.html`
- Wait for upload complete
- Verify file appears in public_html list

**File 2: .htaccess**
- Upload `htaccess-force-index` 
- Rename to `.htaccess` (with dot)
- Set permissions: 644

**File 3: index.html**
- Upload `fuji-test-simple.html` again
- Rename to `index.html`
- Set permissions: 644

### 5. VERIFY UPLOAD
- Check file list in public_html
- Should see: `.htaccess`, `index.html`, `fuji-test-simple.html`
- File sizes should be > 0 bytes

### 6. TEST WEBSITE
Wait 2-3 minutes, then test:
- http://fujiglobal.kr
- Should show: "âœ… FUJI Global Korea Website Successfully Deployed!"

## BACKUP METHOD - IF CPANEL UPLOAD FAILS:

### FTP UPLOAD:
- Host: server37.shared.spaceship.host
- Username: [your spaceship username]
- Password: [your spaceship password]
- Directory: /public_html/

### ALTERNATIVE - CONTACT SPACESHIP SUPPORT:
Email: support@spaceship.host
Request: "Please help upload website files to public_html directory"

## FILES TO UPLOAD (ALREADY CREATED):
- âœ… fuji-test-simple.html (2KB simple test)
- âœ… htaccess-force-index (server config)
- âœ… fujiglobal-final.html (full website backup)

**The issue is NOT the files - they are perfect. Issue is upload location or process.**
