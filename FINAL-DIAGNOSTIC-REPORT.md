# ðŸš¨ WEBSITE DEPLOYMENT - FINAL DIAGNOSTIC REPORT

## CURRENT STATUS: Directory listing still showing

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
1. **File Upload Issue**: Files not reaching correct directory
2. **Server Configuration**: DirectoryIndex not recognizing files
3. **Permissions Problem**: Files uploaded but not readable
4. **Cache Issue**: Server/browser cache preventing updates

## FINAL SOLUTION STRATEGY:

### UPLOAD ALL THESE FILES TO public_html:
1. **fuji-test-simple.html** (minimal test - 2KB)
2. **fuji-website.php** (PHP version with server info)
3. **fujiglobal-final.html** (full production website - 15KB)
4. **htaccess-force-index** â†’ rename to **.htaccess**

### UPLOAD VERIFICATION:
After upload, files should be visible at:
- http://fujiglobal.kr/fuji-test-simple.html
- http://fujiglobal.kr/fuji-website.php
- http://fujiglobal.kr/fujiglobal-final.html

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
1. Root domain (fujiglobal.kr) should redirect to fuji-test-simple.html
2. If PHP is enabled, fuji-website.php will show server info
3. Full website available at fujiglobal-final.html

## TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS:

### If files return 404:
- Files not uploaded to public_html
- Wrong file path in hosting
- File names case-sensitive issue

### If still directory listing:
- .htaccess not uploaded or not working
- Server doesn't support .htaccess
- DirectoryIndex directive ignored

### If blank page:
- File permissions wrong (not 644)
- File content corrupted during upload
- Server configuration issue

## BACKUP PLAN:
Contact Spaceship support with these specific requests:
1. Verify public_html directory is web root
2. Check if .htaccess files are supported
3. Manually verify file upload location
4. Request cache clear on server side

**Upload all 4 files - one of them WILL work!**
