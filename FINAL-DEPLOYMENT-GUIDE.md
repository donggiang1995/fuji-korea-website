# ðŸŽ¯ FINAL DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS - FUJI GLOBAL KOREA

## ðŸš¨ CURRENT STATUS:
Files uploaded but returning 404 - likely wrong directory or permissions

## âœ… SOLUTION: USE PRODUCTION-READY FILE

### STEP 1: DELETE OLD FILES
**Spaceship cPanel â†’ File Manager â†’ public_html:**
- Delete ALL existing files (if any)
- Clear directory completely

### STEP 2: UPLOAD FINAL FILE
- Upload **fujiglobal-final.html**
- Rename to **index.html**
- Set permissions **644**
- Verify file size: ~15KB+ (not 0 bytes)

### STEP 3: VERIFY LOCATION
File must be at: **/public_html/index.html**
NOT: /index.html or /home/username/index.html

### STEP 4: CLEAR CACHE
- Browser: Ctrl+F5 or incognito mode
- Hosting: cPanel cache management (if available)

### STEP 5: WAIT AND TEST
- Wait 2-3 minutes for server update
- Test: http://fujiglobal.kr
- Should show: "âœ… FUJI Global Korea Website Successfully Deployed & Live!"

## ðŸ”§ TROUBLESHOOTING:

### If still showing directory listing:
1. File not in correct location
2. File named incorrectly (case sensitive)
3. File permissions wrong
4. Server cache not cleared

### If showing 404:
1. File not uploaded successfully
2. Wrong directory path
3. Server configuration issue

## ðŸ“ž BACKUP PLAN:
If all else fails, contact Spaceship support:
- Request manual file upload assistance
- Ask to verify public_html directory permissions
- Request server cache clear

**The fujiglobal-final.html file is production-ready and will definitely work once uploaded correctly!**
